### Projects
0. Creating and Setting up your Git and GitHub account
   * Step 1 - Create an account on GitHub (if you do not have one already)
   * Step 2 - Create a personal access token (PAT) on GitHub :point_right: [Tip](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
   * Step 3 - Update your profile on the Intranet
   * Step 4 - Create your first repository
   * Step 5 - Open the sandbox and start the `>_Webterm`
      * Clone your repository
      ```
      # replace {YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN} with your token from step 1
      # Replace {YOUR_USERNAME} with your username from step 0 and 1
      root@896cf839cf9a:/# git clone https://{YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN}@github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/alx-zero_day.git                  
      Cloning into 'alx-zero_day'...
      warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.       
      ```
      **Pro-Tip**: On windows, use CTRL + A + V to paste in the web terminal
   * Step 6 - Create the README.md and push the modifications
      * Navigate to this new directory
      * Create README.md with the content `My first readme`
      * Update your git identity
      ```
      root@896cf839cf9a:/alx-pre_course# git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
      root@896cf839cf9a:/alx-pre_course# git config --global user.name "Your Name"
      ```
      * Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message "My first commit" and push to the remote server/origin

1. Creating a new directory 0x03-git in your alx-zero_day repo.
2. Creating other directories inside 0x03-git and creating empty files and non-empty files
4. Creating a branch `update_script` and creating new files in this branch and updating existing ones and switching back to `main` branch to update some files again
5. Updating the README.md file from GitHub.com and getting all changes of the main branch locally
6. Resolving merge conflicts caused by an attempt to merge the branch `update_script` to `main`
7. Creating a `.gitignore` file and defining a rule to never push `~` files (generated by Emacs). [Tips](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
